## Functions

In this project you can find the folder [tasks](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/tree/master/tasks) with four functions, each of them makes text "scrambled" in it's own way.

Function [one](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/one.py) randomly reorders all but the first and the last letter of each word of a text.

Function [two](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/two.py)  randomly reorders all the letters in each word of a text.

Function [three](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/three.py) randomly reorders all the letters in words that are shorter then a given number of letters.

Function [four](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/four.py) randomly makes some letters  lowercase and some uppercase.

If you would like to see the functions one by one, you can run the files [one](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/one.py), [two](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/two.py), [three](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/three.py), [four](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/four.py) respectively.

The file [utils](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/utils.py) has all the functions that were used more than once in this project.

### Tesing
To test all of the functions you need to run the file [main](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/main.py), as it contains all the tests for all the functions, mentioned above.
