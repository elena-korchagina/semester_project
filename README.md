## Functions

In this project you can find the folder [tasks](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/tree/master/tasks) with four functions, each of them makes text "scrambled" in it's own way.

Function [one](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/one.py) randomly reorders all but the first and the last letter of each word of a text. 
Example: What can we do with the drunken sailor? -> Waht can we do wtih the durnekn sloair?

Function [two](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/two.py)  randomly reorders all the letters in each word of a text. 
Example: What can we do with the drunken sailor? -> Tahw acn ew od hwit hte unekrnd lsaoir?

Function [three](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/three.py) randomly reorders all the letters in words that are shorter then a given number of letters. 
Example: What can we do with the drunken sailor? -> What acn ew od with het drunken sailor?

Function [four](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/four.py) randomly makes some letters  lowercase and some uppercase. 
Example: What can we do with the drunken sailor? -> WHAT cAn wE do WiTH tHe DrUnkEN sAIloR?

If you would like to see the functions one by one, you can run the files [one](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/one.py), [two](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/two.py), [three](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/three.py), [four](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/four.py) respectively.

The file [utils](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/tasks/utils.py) has all the functions that were used more than once in this project.

## Tesing
To test all of the functions you need to run the file [main](https://github.com/elena-korchagina/semester_project/blob/master/main.py), as it contains all the tests for all the functions, mentioned above.
